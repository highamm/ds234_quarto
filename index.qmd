## Course Information

Welcome to STAT 234! The overall purpose of this course is learn the data science skills necessary to complete large-scale data analysis projects. The tool that we will be using to achieve this goal is the statistical software language `R`. We will work with a wide variety of interesting data sets throughout the semester to build our `R` skills. In particular, we will focus on the Data Analysis Life Cycle (Grolemund and Wickham 2020):

![](data-science.png)

We will put more emphasis on the *Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Communicate* parts of the cycle, as an introduction to *Modeling* part is covered in STAT 213.

### Use of `R` and `RStudio`

We will use the statistical software `R` to construct graphs and analyze data. A few notes:

-   `R` and `RStudio` are both free to use.
-   We will primarily be using the SLU `R Studio` server at first: <a href="rstudio.stlawu.local:8787" target="_blank">rstudio.stlawu.local:8787</a>.
-   Additionally, we will be using `RMarkdown` for data analysis reports. *Note*: It's always nice to start assignments and projects as early as possible, but this is particularly important to do for assignments and projects involving `R`. It's no fun to try and figure out why code is not working at the last minute. If you start early enough though, you will have plenty of time to seek help and therefore won't waste a lot of time on a coding error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## General Course Outcomes

1.  *Import* data of a few different types into `R` for analysis.

2.  *Tidy* data into a form that can be more easily visualized, summarised, and modeled.

3.  *Transform*, *Wrangle*, and *Visualize* variables in a data set to assess patterns in the data.

4.  *Communicate* the results of your analysis to a target audience with a written report, or, possibly an oral presentation.

5.  Practice reproducible statistical practices through the use of `Quarto` for data analysis projects.

6.  Explain why it is ethically important to consider the context that a data set comes in.

7.  Develop the necessary skills to be able to ask and answer future data analysis questions on your own, either using `R` or another program, such as Python.

To paraphrase the *R for Data Science* textbook, about 80% of the skills necessary to do a complete data analysis project can be learned through coursework in classes like this one. But, 20% of any particular project will involve learning new things that are specific to that project. Achieving Goal \# 6 will allow you to learn this extra 20% on your own.

## How You Will Be Assessed

The components to your grade are described below:

-   Modules

Aside from the first module (which has a unique structure), the modules in the course will be composed of either:

1. An exercise set due on Monday (worth __10__ points), a take-home quiz due on Wednesday (worth __15__ points), and a handwritten in-class quiz on Wednesday (worth __50__ points). We should have 4 total modules follow this structure.

2. An exercise set due on Monday (worth __10__ points) and an in-class quiz taken on a computer on Wednesday (worth __65__ points). We should have 4 total modules follow this structure.

3. An exercise set due on Monday (worth __10__ points) and a Project due Wednesday (worth __65__ points). We should have 3 total modules follow this structure.

The lowest module will be dropped from your grade so the total number of points available from all modules is `11 * 75 = 825` points.

Additionally, for __one__ module, you are permitted to complete whatever is due for that module late and turn it in by the following Monday. If there is an in-class quiz as part of the module, you should contact me via email to schedule a make-up time to take the quiz (again, this time should be scheduled before class on the following Monday). 

Finally, if you choose to take the (optional) in-person final exam (described below), the score that you earn on that final will replace your second and third-lowest module scores.

-   Class Participation

Class participation will be assessed three times throughout the semester in a 25 point rubric for a total of 75 points. The rubric used will be shared on the first day of class.

-   Final Project

There is one final project, worth 100 points. The primary purpose of the final project is to give you an opportunity to assemble topics throughout the course into one coherent data analysis. You will be able to choose the data set you use for your final project, so you might begin thinking about a particular topic or data set you are interested in exploring. The final project will be presented in a format to be decided later in the semester.

-   Final Exam

There is an optional Final Exam. You **must** be on campus for our final exam time if you would like to take the optional final exam.

If you take the final exam and if your final exam score percentage is better than your 2nd and 3rd lowest module grades, then they will be replaced with your final exam score. For example, suppose your 12 module scores are: `75, 75, 73, 73, 70, 70, 69, 68, 50, 44, 20, 0`. You take the final exam and score a `80% = 60 / 75`. Then, your new module scores would be: `75, 75, 73, 73, 70, 70, 69, 68, 50, 60, 60, 0`. The `0` would still be dropped as your lowest module score.

If you take the final exam and score worse than your 2nd and 3rd lowest module scores, then those scores will not be replaced.

### Breakdown

-   825 points for Modules
-   75 points for Class Participation
-   100 points for the Final Project

Points add up to 1000 so your grade at the end of the semester will be the number of points you've earned across all categories divided by 1000.

### Grading Scale

The following is a *rough* grading scale. I reserve the right to make any changes to the scale if necessary.

| Grade  | 4.0      | 3.75    | 3.5     | 3.25    | 3.0     | 2.75    | 2.5     | 2.25    | 2.0     | 1.75    | 1.5     | 1.25    | 1.0     | 0.0   |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Points | 950-1000 | 920-949 | 890-919 | 860-889 | 830-859 | 810-829 | 770-809 | 750-769 | 720-749 | 700-719 | 670-699 | 640-669 | 600-639 | 0-599 |

## Collaboration, Diversity, Accessibility, and Academic Integrity

### Rules for Collaboration

Collaboration with your classmates on exercises, take-home quizzes, and projects is encouraged, but you must follow these guidelines:

-   you must state the name(s) of who you collaborated with at the top of each assessment.
-   all work must be your own. This means that you should **never** send someone your code via email or let someone directly type code off of your screen. Instead, you can talk about strategies for solving problems and help or ask someone about a coding error.
-   you may use the Internet and StackExchange, but you also should not copy paste code directly from the website, without citing that you did so.
-   for exercises and take-home quizzes, you may use ChatGPT (or other AI) to help with parts of problems, but you __must__ clearly state any queries you made to ChatGPT within your exercise set, project, or take-home quiz. Using ChatGPT (or other AI) without explicitly citing you did so is academic dishonesty.
-   this isn't a rule, but keep in mind that collaboration and use of ChatGPT/AI is not permitted on in-class quizzes. Therefore, when working with someone, make sure that you are both really learning so that you both can have success on the non-collaborative assessments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Diversity Statement

Diversity encompasses differences in age, colour, ethnicity, national origin, gender, physical or mental ability, religion, socioeconomic background, veteran status, sexual orientation, and marginalized groups. The interaction of different human characteristics brings about a positive learning environment. Diversity is both respected and valued in this classroom.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Accessibility Statement

If you have a specific learning profile, medical and or mental health condition and need accommodations, please be sure to contact the Student Accessibility Services Office right away so they can help you get the accommodations you require. If you need to use any accommodations in this class, please meet with your instructor early and provide them with your Individualized Educational Accommodation Plan (IEAP) letter so you can have the best possible experience this semester.

Although not required, your instructor would like to know of any accommodations that are needed at least 10 days before a quiz or test. Please be proactive and set up an appointment to meet with someone from the Student Accessibility Services Office.

**Color-Vision Deficiency:** If you are Color-Vision Deficient, the Student Accessibility Services office has on loan glasses for students who are color vision deficient. Please contact the office to make an appointment.

For more specific information about setting up an appointment with Student Accessibility Services please see the listed options below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Academic Dishonesty

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Any specific policies for this course are supplementary to the

Honor Code. According to the St. Lawrence University Academic Honor Policy,

1.  It is assumed that all work is done by the student unless the instructor/mentor/employer gives specific permission for collaboration.
2.  Cheating on examinations and tests consists of knowingly giving or using or attempting to use unauthorized assistance during examinations or tests.
3.  Dishonesty in work outside of examinations and tests consists of handing in or presenting as original work which is not original, where originality is required.

*Claims of ignorance and academic or personal pressure are unacceptable as excuses for academic dishonesty.* Students must learn what constitutes one's own work and how the work of others must be acknowledged.

For more information, refer to [www.stlawu.edu/acadaffairs/**academic**\_**honor**\_policy.pdf](../../C:%5CUsers%5Ciramler%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cwww.stlawu.edu%5Cacadaffairs%5Cacademic_honor_policy.pdf).

To avoid academic dishonesty, it is important that you follow all directions and collaboration rules and ask for clarification if you have any questions about what is acceptable for a particular assignment or exam. If I suspect academic dishonesty, a score of zero will be given for the entire assignment in which the academic dishonesty occurred **for all individuals involved** and Academic Honor Council will be notified. If a pattern of academic dishonesty is found to have occurred, a grade of 0.0 for the entire course can be given.

It is important to work in a way that maximizes your learning. Be aware that students who rely too much on others for the homework and projects tend to do poorly on the quizzes and exams.

*Please note that in addition the above, any assignments in which your score is reduced due to academic dishonesty will not be dropped according to the quiz policy e.g., if you receive a zero on a quiz because of academic dishonesty, it will not be dropped from your grade.*
