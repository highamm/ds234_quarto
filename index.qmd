## Course Information

Welcome to DATA/STAT 234! The overall purpose of this course is learn the data science skills necessary to complete large-scale data analysis projects. The tool that we will be using to achieve this goal is the statistical software language `R`. We will work with a wide variety of interesting data sets throughout the semester to build our `R` skills. In particular, we will focus on the Data Analysis Life Cycle (Grolemund and Wickham 2020):

![](data-science.png)

We will put more emphasis on the *Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Communicate* parts of the cycle, as an introduction to *Modeling* part is covered in STAT 213.

### Use of `R` and `RStudio`

We will use the statistical software `R` to construct graphs and analyze data. A few notes:

-   `R` and `RStudio` are both free to use.
-   Additionally, we will be using `Quarto` for data analysis reports. *Note*: It's always nice to start assignments and projects as early as possible, but this is particularly important to do for assignments and projects involving `R`. It's no fun to try and figure out why code is not working at the last minute. If you start early enough though, you will have plenty of time to seek help and therefore won't waste a lot of time on a coding error.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## General Course Outcomes

1.  *Import* data of a few different types into `R` for analysis.

2.  *Tidy* data into a form that can be more easily visualized, summarised, and modeled.

3.  *Transform*, *Wrangle*, and *Visualize* variables in a data set to assess patterns in the data.

4.  *Communicate* the results of your analysis to a target audience with a written report, or, possibly an oral presentation.

5.  Practice reproducible statistical practices through the use of `Quarto` for data analysis projects.

6.  Explain why it is ethically important to consider the context that a data set comes in.

7.  Develop the necessary skills to be able to ask and answer future data analysis questions on your own, either using `R` or another program, such as Python.

To paraphrase the *R for Data Science* textbook, about 80% of the skills necessary to do a complete data analysi s project can be learned through coursework in classes like this one. But, 20% of any particular project will involve learning new things that are specific to that project. Achieving Goal \# 7 will allow you to learn this extra 20% on your own.

## How You Will Be Assessed

The components to your grade are described below:

-   Modules

Aside from the first module (which has a unique structure), the modules in the course will be composed of either:

1. A reading assignment due on Monday (worth __5__ points), a take-home quiz due on Wednesday (worth __5__ points), and a handwritten in-class quiz on Wednesday (worth __70__ points). We should have 4 total modules follow this structure.

2. A reading assignment on Monday (worth __5__ points), a take-home quiz due on Wednesday (worth __5__ points), and an in-class coding quiz taken on a computer on Wednesday (worth __70__ points). We should have 3 total modules follow this structure.

3. An reading assignment due on Monday (worth __5__ points), a participation assessment (worth __5__ points), a Project due Wednesday (worth __35__ points), and a handwritten in-class assessment specifically about the Project on Wednesday (worth __40__ points). We should have 3 total modules follow this structure.

The lowest module will be dropped from your grade so the total number of points available from all modules is `10 * 80 = 800` points.

Additionally, for __one__ module, you are permitted to complete whatever is due for that module late and turn it in by the following class period. You can contact me via email to schedule a make-up time to take the in-person-quiz part of the module (again, this time should be scheduled so that you make up the quiz before the following class). 

Finally, if you choose to take the (optional) in-person final exam (described below), the score that you earn on that final will replace your second lowest module score.

-   Participation

At three times throughout the semester, you will be asked to assess and reflect upon your participation and engagement in this course. Each assessment will be worth __20 points__ (for a total of __60 points__) throughout the semester. The specific assessment will be shared on Canvas.

<!-- 26 days total if I subtract Week 0, all quiz days, and all days after the final quiz. -->
<!-- 25 days total if I also subtract the Friday before spring break -->

<!-- There will be approximately 24 days of class where you turn in a sketch or a strategy. However, life happens and you may need to miss a couple of classes. Therefore, participation will be graded out of __80 points__. There will not be extra credit for earning more than 80 points so that no one is penalized for needing to miss a couple of classes. There will not be any make-ups for participation. -->

-   Final Project

There is one final project, worth 80 points. The primary purpose of the final project is to give you an opportunity to assemble topics throughout the course into one coherent data analysis. You will be able to choose the data set you use for your final project, so you might begin thinking about a particular topic or data set you are interested in exploring. The final project will be presented in a format to be decided later in the semester.

-   Final Exam

There is an optional Final Exam worth 60 points. You **must** be on campus for our final exam time if you would like to take the optional final exam. If you do not take the optional final, then the __average__ of your 10 highest module scores will be used for the 60 points for this exam. 

If you take the final exam and if your final exam score percentage is better than your 2nd lowest module grade, then that grade will be replaced with your final exam score. For example, suppose your 11 module scores are: `80, 80, 75, 75, 70, 59, 58, 50, 34, 15, 0`. You take the final exam and score a `54 / 60 = 90%`. Then, the `54` is used for your final exam score and your new module scores would be: `80, 80, 75, 75, 70, 59, 58, 50, 34, 72, 0`. (The second lowest value of `15` is replaced by 90% of 80, which is `72`. The `0` would still be dropped as your lowest module score).

### Breakdown

-   800 points for Modules
-   60 points for Participation
-   60 points for the (optional) Final Exam
-   80 points for the Final Project

Points add up to 1000 so your grade at the end of the semester will be the number of points you've earned across all categories divided by 1000.

### Grading Scale

The following is a *rough* grading scale. I reserve the right to make any changes to the scale if necessary.

| Grade  | 4.0      | 3.75    | 3.5     | 3.25    | 3.0     | 2.75    | 2.5     | 2.25    | 2.0     | 1.75    | 1.5     | 1.25    | 1.0     | 0.0   |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Points | 950-1000 | 920-949 | 890-919 | 860-889 | 830-859 | 800-829 | 770-799 | 750-769 | 720-749 | 700-719 | 670-699 | 640-669 | 600-639 | 0-599 |

## Collaboration, Diversity, Accessibility, and Academic Integrity

### Rules for Collaboration and AI

Collaboration with your classmates on exercises, take-home quizzes, and projects is encouraged, but you must follow these guidelines:

- Each project and assignment will have a written statement about the AI policy. Make sure to carefully read and follow this policy! Note that you are never permitted to use generative AI on in-class quizzes. 
-   you must state the name(s) of who you collaborated with at the top of each assessment.
-   all work must be your own. This means that you should **never** send someone your code via email or let someone directly type code off of your screen. Instead, you can talk about strategies for solving problems and help or ask someone about a coding error.
-   you may use the Internet and StackExchange, but you also should not copy paste code directly from the website, without citing that you did so. 
-   any code that is from outside of our class and course materials will not be graded, unless you cite the specific source for where you obtained that code.

My advice for this course is to simply not use generative AI for anything in the class. This is a foundational course, and I have found that students who use AI (even within the rules of the course) rarely benefit in terms of learning. If you have a question about anything or have an error in your code, I am always happy to help!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Diversity Statement

Diversity encompasses differences in age, colour, ethnicity, national origin, gender, physical or mental ability, religion, socioeconomic background, veteran status, sexual orientation, and marginalized groups. The interaction of different human characteristics brings about a positive learning environment. Diversity is both respected and valued in this classroom.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Accessibility Statement

The message below is copied from the Student Accessibility Services Office:

Your experience in this class is important to me. It is the policy and practice of St. Lawrence University to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law. If you have established accommodations with the Student Accessibility Services Office in the past, please activate your accommodations so we can discuss how they will be implemented in this course.

If you have not yet established services through the Student Accessibility Services Office but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), please contact the Student Accessibility Services Office directly to set up a meeting.  The Student Accessibility Services Office will work with you on the interactive process that establishes reasonable accommodations.

### Academic Dishonesty

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Any specific policies for this course are supplementary to the

Honor Code. According to the St. Lawrence University Academic Honor Policy,

1.  It is assumed that all work is done by the student unless the instructor/mentor/employer gives specific permission for collaboration.
2.  Cheating on examinations and tests consists of knowingly giving or using or attempting to use unauthorized assistance during examinations or tests.
3.  Dishonesty in work outside of examinations and tests consists of handing in or presenting as original work which is not original, where originality is required.

*Claims of ignorance and academic or personal pressure are unacceptable as excuses for academic dishonesty.* Students must learn what constitutes one's own work and how the work of others must be acknowledged.

For more information, refer to [www.stlawu.edu/acadaffairs/**academic**\_**honor**\_policy.pdf](../../C:%5CUsers%5Ciramler%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cwww.stlawu.edu%5Cacadaffairs%5Cacademic_honor_policy.pdf).

To avoid academic dishonesty, it is important that you follow all directions and collaboration rules and ask for clarification if you have any questions about what is acceptable for a particular assignment or exam. If I suspect academic dishonesty, a score of zero will be given for the entire assignment in which the academic dishonesty occurred **for all individuals involved** and Academic Honor Council will be notified. If a pattern of academic dishonesty is found to have occurred, a grade of 0.0 for the entire course can be given.

It is important to work in a way that maximizes your learning. Be aware that students who rely too much on others for the homework and projects tend to do poorly on the quizzes and exams.

*Please note that in addition the above, any assignments in which your score is reduced due to academic dishonesty will not be dropped according to the quiz policy e.g., if you receive a zero on a quiz because of academic dishonesty, it will not be dropped from your grade.*
