__Exercise 1__. 

```{r}
fitness_df <- read_csv(here::here("data/higham_fitness_notclean.csv"),
                       col_types = cols(stepgoal = col_logical(),
                                        month = col_factor(),
                                        weekday = col_factor()))
fitness_df
```

__Exercise 2__. SLU keeps track of diversity of students and faculty through time and makes this data public on the following website: <a href="https://www.stlawu.edu/ir/diversity/faculty" target="_blank">https://www.stlawu.edu/ir/diversity/faculty</a>. Use `rvest` to scrape one of the data tables into `R`.

```{r}
library(rvest)
url <- "https://www.stlawu.edu/offices/institutional-research/student-diversity-2021"
h <- read_html(url)
tab <- h |> html_nodes("table")
obj <- tab[[1]] |> html_table(fill = TRUE)
obj
```
